Analysis of Supermarket Sales Data

This project analyzes the sales data of a supermarket using various data visualization and statistical techniques. The dataset is first cleaned and explored, and then various visualizations are created to gain insights into the sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

The analysis includes:

- Distribution of total sales
- Monthly sales trends
- Branch-wise sales
- Product line analysis
- Customer type analysis
- Payment method analysis
- Product-wise quantity and revenue analysis
- Correlation matrix
- Time series decomposition
- Skewness and kurtosis of total sales
- 

The project uses popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statsmodels to perform the analysis.

This project can be useful for supermarket owners, managers, and analysts to gain insights into their sales data and make informed decisions.

To run the project, simply download the notebook and run it in a Jupyter environment with the required librariesÂ installed.
